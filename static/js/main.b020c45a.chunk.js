Chemistry was my specialty in the Hanoi-Amsterdam High School for Gifted Students. However, after graduating from high school, I recognized that information technology was my actual calling. As a result, I opted to pursue my first job as a web developer for a small software firm, where I worked for a year before returning to RMIT to continue my studies. I consider myself to be a lifelong student. As a result, I'm constantly keen to learn new technologies and put them into practice as quickly as feasible, usually through a personal project. I now only speak English and Vietnamese, but I would like to acquire another language (French or Spanish) in the future. I also enjoy reading nonfiction books and frequently write (in Vietnamese) and publish pieces on my own blog. It's where I share my experience and advice with readers in order to help them be more productive and live a healthier lifestyle. Since high school, I've been attracted by the rapid expansion of IT applications. My interest in this topic has grown as a result of reading about the founders of significant computer firms, particularly Steve Jobs' story of founding Apple from his garage. In terms of IT, I'm particularly interested in web and app development. As a result, after graduating from high school, I opted to start working as a web developer. My coding and teamwork abilities have improved dramatically after a year of working with my team to produce sophisticated e-commerce websites.","DAU HOANG MINH",'My student number is s3926201, and my name is Dau Hoang Minh. I enjoy listening to music, playing board games, and being involved in charitable and environmental organizations. I\'ve had an interest in computers since I was a youngster. My sister was studying for a "Master of Information Technology" when I was a kid, and I used to pester her with IT inquiries. My sister then went through some fundamental IT words with me, such as the Internet, applications, hacking, data storage, and so on. For me, the computer was a magnificent object that had a whole new universe within it at the moment. I was given the opportunity to learn the Python programming language in high school. Although most of my classmates are uninterested in this topic, I find myself very lucky to have this fascinating opportunity. I also represented my school in a tiny hackathon called "Hello World," where my team placed in the top five of the most successful teams. As a result of those experiences, I got a lot more confident in my abilities to study this area. Therefore, I chose RMIT University to pursue a "Bachelor of Information Technology."',"DANG THAI HOANG",'My student number is s3927234, and my name is Dang Thai Hoang. My friends frequently use the terms "friendly" and "hilarious" to describe me. I enjoy learning many topics, including design, art, and science. Music is also a big passion of my life, both listening to it and playing it. Since I was a small child, I\'ve always been a wicked kid who has always wanted to learn new things, especially about technology. My father and I spent a lot of time together trying to figure out topics like "What is inside a computer?" "How does a touch-screen work?" and "How does a website work?". I fell in love with this topic of study and hoped that I would be able to learn more about it in the future. At the moment, I am very proud to be a student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, where I am majoring in Information Technology (IT). I\'ve learned programming fundamentals so far using languages like Python, HTML, and CSS. Furthermore, I am familiar with basic UI and UX ideas by spending a few years developing logos and retouching photos. Learning at RMIT, I was fortunate enough to be assigned to a team of talented individuals; we are all IT enthusiasts who constantly go out of our way to assist one another. We are Spotifour!',"LE TRINH QUOC HUYNH",'I am Le Trinh Quoc Huynh, my student number is s3925997, and my email is s3925997@rmit.edu.vn. I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam\'s capital city. I can understand how Vietnamese culture has evolved through time since I live in an extended family. Unlike many other Vietnamese families, my parents do not encourage me to study hard or obtain straight A\'s in school; instead, they want me to be self-aware and fully accountable for my studies. In addition to my mother tongue, I am also proficient in English. I\'ve always wanted to study Chinese but have never had the opportunity. Physical activities and computer games do not stimulate me. Therefore, I spend most of my time listening to music. Opera is one of my favourite musical genres, and while it is popular in many European nations, few Vietnamese people love listening to it. Despite my passion for technology, I understood very little about programming or coding until I started high school. Ta Quang Buu High School was where I spent three years of my life. We were able to study a topic known as "STEM," which stands for "Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics." Teachers showed us how to put together various scientific projects. However, my interest in technology was sparked by a competition where I paired up with a buddy to compete in a Scientific Contest organized by the Hanoi Department of Education and Training. We created a system that monitors the water environment in real-time. Nonetheless, as high school students, we lacked the necessary understanding to build such a complex project. Consequently, we learned a lot about coding, utilizing and calibrating sensors, etc.'],teamProfile:["Personality assessments provide profiles of team members, which may be used to increase teamwork by bridging gaps in communication. These findings, we feel, will assist us in identifying our strengths and flaws. MBTI tests help us know more about each other\u2019s personalities and position each person in roles that best fit their abilities. With the learning style test results, we can decide more accurately which member should do which part of the assignment. For the third test, all four of us chose various assessments on various platforms. However, most of the tests were creativity tests, so it is handy for us to distribute our work when tasks related to new ideas are needed.","Each of us receives and processes information differently, and our work habits reflect these variances. For example, Minh\u2019s personality type is ESFJ based on the Myers-Briggs test, which indicates that he is an extroverted, enthusiastic individual who loves to work in groups rather than alone. In addition, he is also practical, focused on past or present occurrences, and extremely structured, placing a premium on clarity and planning. Therefore, to increase efficiency when working with others, Minh will offer to undertake the task that is acceptable for him. Since he is a very structured individual who prefers structure and organization to spontaneity, as part of a team, he will organize the assignment, distribute responsibilities evenly among the team members, and keep track of the progress.","When it comes to teamwork, it is suggested that Hoang take on the position of campaigner. He always finds methods to make our workplaces more pleasurable by encouraging everyone to share their thoughts and enthusiasm. Furthermore, tasks involving visuals pique his attention, and he will always do his best, in collaboration with our team, to come up with novel concepts. He is generally the one who wants to do research and come up with fresh ideas.","In terms of learning style, Linh considers himself to be a Visual/Tactical learner. To memorize, his major study method is to convert notes into charts and diagrams. Moreover, he can learn quickly by seeing others perform activities and then attempting to perform them on his own. As a result, it appeals that he would be the one who is capable of bringing an idea to real life. When working on assignments, he is always the person to expand and develop our thoughts on different topics.","With a creativity score of 72.01, which is higher than the typical score, Huynh seems to be the one who can think outside of the box and come up with new ideas for the whole team.","All these test results are not only convenient for us to divide work, but they also help us communicate with each other better. For instance, the Myers-Briggs test may indicate one\u2019s personality, including if they are extroverted or introverted. Because their communication is more assertive, team members who endeavor to understand one another will likely increase their overall team performance. Team members will comprehend the best ways to interact with one another if they are aware of their own personality type and that of the other team members."],idealJobs:["All four positions require us to have a Bachelor\u2019s degree or a Master\u2019s degree and be quite experienced when working with IT problems.

This field varies from building just a single static page to enterprise applications that have millions of users. It can be divided into many sub-fields, including web engineering, web design, web server, network security, etc. Many programming languages and platforms can be used in the process of making a website, depending on the scale, resources, and purposes of the project.","Web development has experienced incredible improvement over the last decade. It is an essential part of any industry at the moment. For example, business owners can now open an e-commerce website to raise their sales. In large corporations, websites are used to extract, visualize, and analyze data to help them come up with better business solutions. In addition, using websites is an excellent resource for people to consume information and even create and share their content in the form of blogs or social media. Modern websites provide users with a high-quality user interface and dynamic content, which means that what the website displays will change according to users' input. Moreover, with the help of databases, all of the users' data can be saved for their future sessions. Companies can also utilize that information to develop strategies to help keep old customers and attract new ones. Furthermore, everyone can have their online presence on the Internet; they can upload, share, and even sell any digital product like images or videos on the Internet. Humans can contact each other by chatting or video calls by using social platforms.","Web development will undoubtedly keep growing in the next few years. The number of new back-ends and front-ends frameworks for building websites will continue to rise, allowing IT specialists to develop, maintain, and deploy websites most efficiently. As a result, websites will see a massive improvement in performance and complexity. More websites will have 3D graphical interfaces, providing users with a more realistic and interactive experience. This can even help simulate real-life situations for science research, like autonomous cars or even astronomy exploration. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies can also be applied to e-commerce and entertainment websites for suggesting recommendations for users based on their historical use of the website. Website owners can use chatbots on their sites to resolve any questions from the customers without the need for virtual assistants. With the help of blockchain, all websites will have much better security and privacy when people can own their digital content and not rely on any network of big corporations.","Those breakthroughs of web development are the results of many reasons. The first and most apparent cause is the thrive of new advanced fields in IT, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain. These fields can be implemented in order to make websites have a higher quality in every aspect ranging from user experience to network privacy. The second reason is that websites have to be continuously improved to meet people's requirements, from day-to-day activities like shopping or connecting to scientific research. The final reason is the massive improvement of electronic devices. More and more types of phones, tablets and desktops with different brands, designs and operating systems are available in the market. As a result, organizations have to develop sites that can run efficiently across all of those devices to continue increasing their revenue."],"What is the likely impact?":["Web development has revolutionized many industries in our lives, and it will assuredly continue doing so in the future. For example, in education, there will be more and more online course websites that can support students from any level to learn any kind of subject they like, from art to science. Moreover, those websites will provide users with experiential learning, when they can practice the skills they just learnt right on the website. This can lead to the steady replacement of online learning to face-face teaching. With the help of AI/ML, entertainment platforms like social media, streaming or gaming will provide users with a much more engaging experience. The number of e-commerce websites will also rise considerably to help business owners increase revenue and allow customers to make online orders and payments easily.","Web development changes many aspects of human habits and improves our lives in many ways. Online businesses, courses and entertainment platforms are constantly being built, maintained, and enhanced to help us have easier, happier, and productive lives.","People across all industries are affected by web development. The IT industry always has to evolve to deliver high-quality websites for other industries. Therefore, people working in this field must always stay up to date with the latest technologies in order to come up with websites that suit users' needs. The development of website technologies can be considered a win-win case for both business owners and customers; business owners can dramatically attract more users and increase their revenue while customers will have a better experience when using the websites.","Web development helps create many IT jobs, ranging from developers, designers to business analysts or testers. The US Department of Labor projects that there will be a 13% growth of jobs for Web Developers and Digital Designers between 2020-2030.

However, the rise of online learning and shopping can have a negative impact on teachers and owners of traditional stores."],"How will this affect me?":["As a student of RMIT, integrating myself with websites is an essential part of my daily routine. I use websites for many purposes, from supporting my study to entertaining. The advancement of website technologies allows me to access and consume the contents of websites much faster and simpler than at the moment. As a result, it will be much more efficient whenever we need to research for my university study. Moreover, with many high-quality and practical online course websites available online, I can study any subjects and new skills that we like without the help of instructors. I also use a lot of entertainment platforms. The advancement of AI/ML and 3D Graphics in websites will bring me a much better time enjoying online games, music, and movies.","Web development has changed my life over the past decades. For example, online payment on websites was unavailable in older days, but now I can transfer money quickly with only a few clicks. Looking into the future, with the rise of blockchain, I can use cryptocurrencies to deal with transactions on websites, which is much more secure than bank transfers. In addition, since website contents are getting more and more privacy and focusing more on individuals instead of communities, I can also create, share and even sell content on the Internet without any issues related to authorization.","My friends will most likely take advantage of the advancement of websites to enhance many parts of their lives, just like me. They will have a better experience while studying, relaxing, shopping or even creating and sharing content on websites.

For instance, Beth Israel is working on a mobile app that will collect data from millions of patients and aid clinicians in providing evidence-based care."],"What is the likely impact?":["Artificial intelligence is used in a wide range of industries, including business, science, manufacturing, transportation, etc. Therefore, its advancement has a significant impact on society.","The positive impact of AI is the improvement in work efficiency. Humans sometimes make mistakes if they are distracted by the surrounding environment. Computers, on the other hand, are solely concerned with performing the tasks at hand. They have been trained to perform millions of calculations to finish tasks with excellent quality in less time. Furthermore, because AI can perform the task of many individuals, there will be a reduction in the number of employees, resulting in lower staffing costs.","The major negative impact of AI is making some people lose their jobs. The most affected people are those who work in jobs that do not require them to be creative or solve ethical issues. Several jobs might be replaced by computers in the future:","- Factory worker: most commodities have already been merchandised with AI, so there will only be one or two supervisors who control the machine.","- Proofreader: While editing takes a lot of time and effort, detecting grammatical errors and sentence structure can be done automatically with applications like Grammarly.","- Driver: We now have self-driving automobiles that go at a modest speed and are aware of the best route to take to reach their destination. As per the Los Angeles Times, self-driving trucks could replace 1.7 million American truckers in the next ten years.","- Security guards: With its high-definition camera, a security robot can easily investigate a building and determine the number of persons in a specific location. It also contains sensors that can detect any suspicious activities and transmit police notifications. AI has an 84 percent possibility of completely automating this industry in the future."],"How will this affect me?":["Artificial intelligence appears in my daily life frequently to fulfill various functions. It improves the convenience and comfort of my life by allowing me to save time on regular duties.","- When I wake up in the morning, I open my iPhone using Face ID. It is essentially an AI-based facial recognition feature that memorizes my face and records the image using 30.000 invisible dots. I just let the smartphone scan my face once, and my iPhone will unlock instantly the next time it sees my face.","- When I have breakfast, I use the digital voice assistant of Apple named Siri \u2013 a form of virtual assistant driven by AI to manage my schedule. I can check the calendars for upcoming events, set alarms to remind me to complete several tasks, play the music I am interested in, etc.","- When I have spare time, I usually watch Netflix. This streaming service also uses AI in its recommendation engine. It will suggest new movies to watch based on my previous viewing history, which has similar genres or actors I admire.","My family members use AI applications in a variety of situations, but they are mostly unaware of it.","- Whenever entering the company, my uncle marks his attendance by using a face-recognition machine, ensuring that he comes to the office on time.","- My mom often buys products online, particularly on e-commerce sites such as Shopee, Tiki, and others. Artificial intelligence is also used by the corporations behind such platforms to handle data and recommend products to consumers, including discount programs and vouchers.","- My sister usually transfers money and pays bills using her banking account. AI assists her in preventing unauthorized persons from making illegal purchases with her credit card."]}},{technology:"Cloud Computing",image:"Cloud.png",description:{"What does it do?":["In recent years, the rapid development of data storage and processing technologies, along with the success of the Internet, has made Cloud Computing more popular now than before. This paradigm provides the uses of computing services over the Internet \u2013 including databases, servers, storage, networking, analytics, software, and intelligence \u2013 with minimal management effort of the users. There are many benefits of Cloud Computing that make it attractive not only to businesses but also to individuals:","- Cost: Cloud computing eliminates the upfront costs of purchasing hardware and software, as well as the costs of setting up and operating on-site data centers.","- Global Scale: the ability to scale elastically provides suitable data.","- Performance: Cloud computing services are delivered through a global network of secure data centers that are updated on a regular basis with the latest generation of fast and efficient computing gear.","- Productivity: Cloud computing removes the need for unnecessary tasks so the IT team can concentrate on their work.","- Reliability: cloud computing enables data backup, disaster recovery.","In practice, cloud platform offers services that can be grouped into three different categories:","- Software as a service (SaaS): a broad range of software offerings on the Cloud, and users can choose which one is suitable for their requirement. Clients can access a software application hosted by the cloud vendor on a pay-per-use basis. Example: Dropbox, Apple iCloud, Google Apps.","- Platform as a Service (PaaS): provides a development platform on the Cloud. Clients can also rent servers, storage, database, software technologies for their works. Example: Google App Engine, Microsoft Window Azure.","- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): offering hardware-related services like servers, networks, and storage. Example: Google, IBM, Microsoft.","For now, there are several common uses of Cloud Computing that businesses can take advantage of:","- File storage: secure access and scalability to increase or decrease storage.","- Big data analytic: data of current market trends, customers, sales performance, and many more.","- Data backups: provides the assurance if users' data becomes compromised.","- Software development: offers tools for continuous integration that make development and testing less complex, faster, and cheaper.","In the near future, Cloud Computing will continue to be an essential target for businesses looking for cost efficiency and increased scalability. According to Forrester Research, the global Cloud infrastructure has gained 35 percent to $120 Billion in 2021 and will continue to take center stage in the development of technologies. Some of the features of Cloud Computing that are likely to be done soon are:","- Going Serverless: a computing model in which cloud providers allocate resources on-demand and take care of the servers on behalf of their customers.","- Automated Cloud Orchestration and Optimization: useful when managing a large quantity of data and the quality of interconnected services.","- Internet of Things Along with Cloud Computing: The IoT field is also one of the leading technologies, and it requires machine-to-machine data transferring, communication, which Cloud Computing can easily help.","- Modular software: modified software provides better security and is more flexible to use compared to traditional ones.","In terms of state-of-the-art implementation of cloud computing, there are key technologies that are currently used for this paradigm:","- Architecture Design of Data Center: The Data Center is a facility in which computer systems and associated components like servers, routers, telecommunication systems are used. The design and planning for this network architecture play a vital role as it will influence other factors like application performance, security, environment control, etc. A good design of a data center network should satisfy the following objectives:","- Resiliency: The ability to recover after failures and ensure maximum uptime without compromising performance.","- Scalability: The ability to broaden data storage and the number of servers.","- Security: The ability to ensure data separation and prevent the access of unauthorized users.","- Performance: the higher the processing speed, the more productive the work.",'- Distributed File System over Cloud: a file system that provides efficient, reliable access to data and allows users to modify it (copy, delete, rewrite, etc.). Each file system is partitioned into different parts called "chunks"; each can be stored on different remote machines to do the parallel execution. Google File System (GFS) and Hadoop Distributed system (HDFS) are two popular file systems built to support large files coming from different sources and various formats.',"- Distributed Applications over Cloud: these are software applications usually stored and executed on the cloud platform and run on multiple systems simultaneously. Unlike traditional applications, which focus on one dedicated system to achieve a task, these distributed systems work on the same network and communicate with each other to complete an assigned mission."],"What is the likely impact?":["The impact of Cloud Computing can be everywhere; it makes changes in the way organizations function:","- On business: Cloud computing allows businesses to manage their resources remotely. It enables business entities to virtually access their information, allowing data to be accessed at any time and from any location. More and more companies are moving towards this technology because of its benefits to the users.","- On Workforce: Cloud computing creates a virtual workplace where several apps and services can be hosted on a single platform. Employees can easily access their work from anywhere in the world at any time, as long as they have access to the Internet. As a result, cloud computing makes working easier and has increased staff productivity. In the future, remote work can be a new trend in businesses.","- On Society: the impacts of Cloud on day-to-day life are in various ways. Social media (E.g. Facebook, Instagram), entertainment (E.g. Netflix, Spotify), shopping (E.g. Amazon, Shopee), education (E.g. Udemy, Linkedin learning) are all using Cloud because of the conveniences it brings not only to the users but also to the service providers. Sooner or later, more and more daily services will have to apply Cloud Computing to their function.","People working in the IT field are the most affected as organizations relocate their networks to Cloud platforms. The needs of some in-house IT jobs like System Administrators, Database Administrators, and Help desk support are predicted to reduce in the future as Cloud can also provide those functions. However, new skills sets and positions will be required as IT jobs migrate from individual organizations to Cloud service providers. Security is a huge issue of Cloud computing, and positions like security architect or security engineer are among the most sought-after jobs. In addition, positions like Cloud administrator, Cloud architect, Cloud engineer play significant roles in building Cloud networks and Cloud management."],"How will this affect me?":["The occurrence of Cloud computing has brought to my daily life many conveniences and changes:","- In education: As I was a kid, I used to go directly to the campus or the teacher's house for extra classes; it took me lots of time travelling and sometimes was inconvenient. However, in recent years, there have been more and more online courses via platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Linkedin Learning, and many of them are interesting. I can stay at home and have access to a variety of courses from programming, mathematics to music tutorials, design studies.","- Personal Storage: This was one of the head-aching problems that I usually had to deal with before knowing about Cloud. A phone with just 16Gb of storage was not enough for a person who loves recording videos like me, and I always needed to use a USB for data transferring. After I knew about Cloud, everything became much easier since I could post, literally, all of my works online via Google Drive or Apple iCloud. In addition, I can access my online storage everywhere I go and with different devices.","- Online Shopping: During the CoVid-19 pandemic time, it is safer to stay at home and order stuff online. Most online shopping platforms are using Cloud to manage customers' information to recommend suitable products to give users like me the best user experiences.","- Social impact: The development of social networks like Facebook or Zalo makes it easier for me to keep in touch with my family and friends through the online community.","- Healthcare: Cloud computing helps me and my family members manage and share health data to keep track of the medical record and health problems.","Cloud Computing plays a significant role in our everyday lives, and shortly, there will be more practical applications of it."]}},{technology:"Autonomous Vehicle",image:"AutoVehicle.png",description:{"What does it do?":["An autonomous vehicle can sense its surroundings and operate without the need for human intervention. At no point is a human passenger necessary to assume control of the car, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. A self-driving automobile can go wherever a regular vehicle can and accomplish everything a skilled human driver can do. Self-driving cars are becoming more popular and fully operational than ever before. Although often advertised as driverless cars, there are currently no fully autonomous vehicles legally operating in countries worldwide.","The American Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines six levels of driving automation, ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully automated). These levels have been approved by the US Department of Transportation and are being applied worldwide.","- Level 0 \u2013 manual driving: Humans operate and control all major systems. This includes cars with cruise control because the driver sets and changes the speed as needed.","- Level 1 - driver assistance: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) help the driver with steering, braking, and acceleration, but not all simultaneously. A rearview camera and features such as vibrating seat alarms are included in ADAS to notify drivers when they stray from their driving lane. When triggered individually by human drivers, the automobile can control several systems, such as adaptive cruise control or automated braking. As a result, most cars nowadays are self-driving at level 1.",'- Level 2 - partial automation: Level 2 takes things a step farther, as one could imagine. The car can be more proactive in managing specific circumstances by integrating two or more advanced driver assistance systems, such as automated lane departure warning, lane maintenance and braking, or changing direction and acceleration. The driver can operate without paying much attention at this level, but they must constantly be "alert" to engage and ready to act.','- Level 3 - conditional automation: The third degree of automaticity, sometimes known as "no need to watch the road" mode, allows the driver to perform other things with their eyes-free, such as glance at a phone or tablet. Level 3 self-driving cars often do not require human intervention at speeds below 60 km/h.',"- Level 4 - high automation: Through constant monitoring of road conditions, the automobile may autonomously change course, brake, or accelerate, and even avoid obstacles at level 4. The level 4 self-driving mechanism can only be triggered on excellent roads, guaranteeing that the vehicle can decelerate and stop safely when needed by enabling the driver to rest and sleep if desired.","- Level 5 \u2013 full automation: This is the highest level, demonstrating an actual self-driving automobile that can operate autonomously in all scenarios and settings without the need for human involvement. When the car is in motion, drivers may easily rest, sleep, or do anything they like. At this level, the automobile lacks even basic features like a steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal. Artificial intelligence is crucial in dealing with circumstances based on data from hundreds of sensors.","Complex technology demands everything from automated to autonomous driving, including advanced sensor technologies, sophisticated control systems, and intelligent actuators. However, it is not just a matter of autonomous cars starting on their own. Safety will remain a primary concern in the future, and passenger comfort will become even more vital.","Driverless cars are no longer the impregnable territory of Ford, Daimler, Toyota, Nissan, etc. but are gradually shifting into the domain of software companies. For driverless car development, software plays the most crucial role. It is likened to the brain, ensuring the operation of the car. If in the past, cars were characterized by engines, transmissions, actuators, steering wheels, gasoline, etc., today, it is like a computer. Software and electricity have replaced the functions of mechanical, human, and fuel factors. A modern car is controlled by 80 to 100 embedded systems; 90% of the car's innovation is now in software, 100% of the car will connect to the Cloud. Technology research on autonomous vehicles is centralized into two main areas: lane detection and object recognition.","- Lane detection: Researchers have been studying this subject for decades. Many premium automobiles include lane detecting systems that have been designed and implemented.","- Object recognition: An essential component of autonomous vehicle systems is object recognition. This technology has recently made significant progress in detecting stationery items such as bicycles, pedestrians, automobiles, traffic signs, and similar objects. It is now progressing to recognizing dynamic things such as vehicles and people moving on the roads."],"What is the likely impact?":["Developing the automobile of the future and the systems architecture that will support it will need extensive long-term collaboration among tech innovators, automakers, telecommunications companies, government agencies, and others. However, automobile technology will still see noteworthy progress in the next three years. With the vastly developing AI technology, vehicles will calculate data from sensors more accurately in different situations. As a result, people will see more and more autonomous cars on the roads of many countries. Autonomous vehicles are indeed the future of transportation. Up to now, in the world, more than 30 companies are investing in the research and development of driverless cars, such as Google, Tesla, Apple, Audi, Nissan, Nvidia, etc. They support this field very strongly. As an electronics manufacturing corporation, Apple recently announced that it has successfully developed self-driving cars by 2024. The race for driverless vehicles still has many technological and technological gaps. 2021 will create an opportunity for legislators and consumers to test the feasibility of applying artificial intelligence in traffic. By 2023, a driver monitoring system will be mandatory on all cars that want to achieve the 5-star Euro NCAP safety certification.","With self-driving car proponents soon circulating, they argue that the technology will reduce car accidents caused by human error. Statistics show that driver error is the leading cause, causing more than 90% of all car crashes, and it is often the errors of driving while drunk, distracted, not moving in the right lane, or not complying with regulations, speed limits, etc. In addition, self-driving cars are expected to reduce traffic jams, as robot cars will be able to travel at higher speeds and closer to other vehicles without obstructing or crashing into them. This will ultimately reduce people's time on the road and save them energy.","When self-driving technology is established, fully autonomous self-driving vehicles will be available, but they might have significant economic implications. Taxi and truck drivers will no longer be required, resulting in many people who are now employed in these positions losing their employment. Trucks on the road without a driver could theoretically operate 24 hours a day, lowering freight expenses. There will be fewer car-truck collisions because there will be no sleepy, distracted, or furious truck drivers behind the wheel."],"How will this affect me?":['Although the automobile is pretty popular nowadays in many developed countries worldwide, this technology has not seemed very practical in Vietnam due to different reasons and challenges. Firstly, many streets in Vietnam still lack road markings or are blurred or covered after a period of use. Secondly, the high traffic density makes the vehicle "embarrassed" because it cannot find a safe distance from other vehicles, especially motorbikes. Thirdly, operating self-driving cars in the situation that Vietnam\'s traffic is still "chaotic" due to lack of synchronization will bring many risks of loss of traffic safety. Many tests have shown that current self-driving cars are only most suitable when running on highways with open lanes and no obstacles. Even in modern and advanced cities, the operation in urban areas still has many problems. Therefore, I believe that I will not have the chance to experience this technology in my home country soon. Even though it will not affect my daily life, I would be happy to try it out in a foreign country someday. Nevertheless, Vietnam is still developing vastly, so I believe that every Vietnamese person will have their own autonomous car one day.']}}],g={overview:"Background noises are something that we do not usually care about; however, they surprisingly have a significant impact on our daily lives.
