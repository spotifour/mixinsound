His company focuses on building e-commerce websites using Magento, an e-commerce platform written in PHP programming language and was acquired by Adobe in May 2018.\",\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"What kind of work is done by the IT professional?\",\n    answer: [\n      \"His company provides eCommerce solutions for customers and builds an ecosystem around Magento, an open-source platform for eCommerce websites. In addition to developing websites, they also create mobile apps, integrate online customer channels with other systems like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), POS (Point Of Sales), and support customers on marketing activities.\",\n      \"Therefore, as a Chief Technology Officer of a technological company, he handles those major areas:\",\n      \"- Develop company technical stacks, keep them up to date with technology changes\",\n      \"- Develop employees’ technical skills\",\n      \"- Deploys, maintains business applications, services, and infrastructure\",\n      \"- Monitors, optimizes, troubleshoots the performance of applications, services and infrastructure\",\n      \"- Do technical lead, write boilerplate code, review code\",\n      \"Besides technical tasks, he also participates in general company management activities like interviewing candidates, reviewing employees annually, and building a company learning culture.\",\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    question:\n      \"What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?\",\n    answer: [\n      \"He interacts with a variety of people at work. Because he is a tech lead, he primarily interacts with the developers. He helps them come up with solutions for their problems, reviews their code, and trains them. Besides that, he also works with the project management and quality assurance teams to discuss projects timeline, working quality, human resources, etc. Last but not least, he also joins with the BA (Business Analysis) team to work directly with the clients in clarifying their business requirements, so his company can provide appropriate solutions for their needs.\",\n      \"In terms of his interaction with other IT professionals, he likes watching videos and reading their blog posts to acquire new skills. Moreover, he also wants to share his knowledge with others in the same ways. Therefore, he has his personal blog for this, where he posts things about Magento, website technologies and DevOps. To attract more people to see his blog, he usually shares posts on programming groups on Facebook or Twitter. He finds that Twitter is a pretty good place where IT professionals can learn new things from others, keep them up to date with technology changes in their fields, as well as share their knowledge.\",\n      \"His role does not require him to contact the general public. His company only provides eCommerce solutions for clients, and those customers are the people who are responsible for managing their web as well as communicating with users - the general public.\",\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?\",\n    answer: [\n      \"He said that he spent the most time reviewing code and setting up a working environment at the company's office. He always prioritizes achieving high coding quality to deliver the best product quality to customers. He takes responsibility for many projects at a time, so reviewing code is the most critical and time-consuming part of his daily work. It usually takes him about 1 - 2 hours to do this daily.\",\n      \"His other tasks include setting up the working environment for each project, deploying websites, providing any supplies if needed, ensuring the team members have everything they need. Every computer comes with an on-ear headphone to keep users from being distracted by outside noises. Each employee also has a personal space where they can store personal items such as writing pads, catalog envelopes, self-stick notes, and so on. Snacks, tea, and coffee are also available on two tables for employees to use whenever they are tired or hungry. Thanks to those working conditions, all technical employees can focus on coding, and not have to worry about other problems that might distract them.\",\n      \"For him, the office is a second home where he eats, sometimes even cooks, does exercises, and communicates with others on a daily basis. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were times that he and his co-workers were not allowed to go to the offices, so he had to spend most of his time working alone at home. However, he still prefers to work in the office rather than at home because meeting offline improves working efficiency and employee relationships.\",\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"What aspect of their position is most challenging?\",\n    answer: [\n      \"In his opinion, the most challenging aspect is training people. Leading people means dealing with different personalities and abilities. He always has to find and understand how to develop an employee to their best version and improve their work skills to add more value to the company in the market. Technically, he thinks that there is no best way to work for everyone. Some may enjoy working with Frontend technologies like Javascript, CSS, React, ... or some may find Backend or DevOps interesting. He identifies their strengths and gives them suggestions, training sessions, or courses so they can develop themselves most effectively.\",\n      \"In addition, interacting with clients is another aspect he finds challenging. He must fill the gap between business people and the technical team because they usually have misunderstandings. Sometimes, the technical team do not understand clearly the requirement of customers and As a technical person, he also needs to understand how customer business works, not only online eCommerce, but also many problems around it, like marketing tools, order management process, stock management, SEO, or any other system.\",\n    ],\n  },\n];\n\nexport const ITTechs = [\n  {\n    technology: \"Web Development\",\n    image: \"Web.png\",\n    description: {\n      \"What does it do?\": [\n        \"Web development is the process of creating a website that is available and can be accessed via the Internet. This field varies from building just a single static page to enterprise applications that have millions of users. It can be divided into many sub-fields, including web engineering, web design, web server, network security, etc. Many programming languages and platforms can be used in the process of making a website, depending on the scale, resources, and purposes of the project.\",\n        \"Web development has experienced incredible improvement over the last decade. It is an essential part of any industry at the moment. For example, business owners can now open an e-commerce website to raise their sales. In large corporations, websites are used to extract, visualize, and analyze data to help them come up with better business solutions. In addition, using websites is an excellent resource for people to consume information and even create and share their content in the form of blogs or social media. Modern websites provide users with a high-quality user interface and dynamic content, which means that what the website displays will change according to users' input. Moreover, with the help of databases, all of the users' data can be saved for their future sessions. Companies can also utilize that information to develop strategies to help keep old customers and attract new ones. Furthermore, everyone can have their online presence on the Internet; they can upload, share, and even sell any digital product like images or videos on the Internet. Humans can contact each other by chatting or video calls by using social platforms.\",\n        \"Web development will undoubtedly keep growing in the next few years. The number of new back-ends and front-ends frameworks for building websites will continue to rise, allowing IT specialists to develop, maintain, and deploy websites most efficiently. As a result, websites will see a massive improvement in performance and complexity. More websites will have 3D graphical interfaces, providing users with a more realistic and interactive experience. This can even help simulate real-life situations for science research, like autonomous cars or even astronomy exploration. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies can also be applied to e-commerce and entertainment websites for suggesting recommendations for users based on their historical use of the website. Website owners can use chatbots on their sites to resolve any questions from the customers without the need for virtual assistants. With the help of blockchain, all websites will have much better security and privacy when people can own their digital content and not rely on any network of big corporations.\",\n        \"Those breakthroughs of web development are the results of many reasons. The first and most apparent cause is the thrive of new advanced fields in IT, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain. These fields can be implemented in order to make websites have a higher quality in every aspect ranging from user experience to network privacy. The second reason is that websites have to be continuously improved to meet people's requirements, from day-to-day activities like shopping or connecting to scientific research. The final reason is the massive improvement of electronic devices. More and more types of phones, tablets and desktops with different brands, designs and operating systems are available in the market. As a result, organizations have to develop sites that can run efficiently across all of those devices to continue increasing their revenue.\"\n      ],\n      \"What is the likely impact?\": [\n        \"Web development has revolutionized many industries in our lives, and it will assuredly continue doing so in the future. For example, in education, there will be more and more online course websites that can support students from any level to learn any kind of subject they like, from art to science. Moreover, those websites will provide users with experiential learning, when they can practice the skills they just learnt right on the website. This can lead to the steady replacement of online learning to face-face teaching. With the help of AI/ML, entertainment platforms like social media, streaming or gaming will provide users with a much more engaging experience. The number of e-commerce websites will also rise considerably to help business owners increase revenue and allow customers to make online orders and payments easily.\",\n        \"Web development changes many aspects of human habits and improves our lives in many ways. Online businesses, courses and entertainment platforms are constantly being built, maintained, and enhanced to help us have easier, happier, and productive lives.\",\n        \"People across all industries are affected by web development. The IT industry always has to evolve to deliver high-quality websites for other industries. Therefore, people working in this field must always stay up to date with the latest technologies in order to come up with websites that suit users' needs. The development of website technologies can be considered a win-win case for both business owners and customers; business owners can dramatically attract more users and increase their revenue while customers will have a better experience when using the websites.\",\n        \"Web development helps create many IT jobs, ranging from developers, designers to business analysts or testers. The US Department of Labor projects that there will be a 13% growth of jobs for Web Developers and Digital Designers between 2020-2030. There have not been many concerns about web development replacing existing jobs. However, the rise of online learning and shopping can have a negative impact on teachers and owners of traditional stores.\"\n      ],\n      \"How will this affect me?\": [\n        \"As a student of RMIT, integrating myself with websites is an essential part of my daily routine. I use websites for many purposes, from supporting my study to entertaining. The advancement of website technologies allows me to access and consume the contents of websites much faster and simpler than at the moment. As a result, it will be much more efficient whenever we need to research for my university study. Moreover, with many high-quality and practical online course websites available online, I can study any subjects and new skills that we like without the help of instructors. I also use a lot of entertainment platforms. The advancement of AI/ML and 3D Graphics in websites will bring me a much better time enjoying online games, music, and movies.\",\n        \"Web development has changed my life over the past decades. For example, online payment on websites was unavailable in older days, but now I can transfer money quickly with only a few clicks. Looking into the future, with the rise of blockchain, I can use cryptocurrencies to deal with transactions on websites, which is much more secure than bank transfers. In addition, since website contents are getting more and more privacy and focusing more on individuals instead of communities, I can also create, share and even sell content on the Internet without any issues related to authorization.\",\n        \"My friends will most likely take advantage of the advancement of websites to enhance many parts of their lives, just like me. They will have a better experience while studying, relaxing, shopping or even creating and sharing content on websites. My family members mostly use websites to update news, and they are not very familiar with complex technologies. Therefore, since websites are being designed to become easier and easier to navigate, my family members will benefit greatly.\"\n      ]\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    technology: \"Artificial Intelligence\",\n    image: \"Ai.png\",\n    description: {\n      \"What does it do?\": [\n        \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a term that refers to the ability of machines to do tasks generally associated with human intellect, such as learning, adapting, self-correction, etc. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows software programs to evolve over time, improving prediction accuracy based on gathered data and, as a result, adapting their behavior to fit the surrounding environment.\",\n        \"Artificial intelligence is an up-and-coming field with a wide range of applications. Although artificial intelligence has only been discovered and studied since the twentieth century, there have been several significant advancements in this technology in different fields.\",\n        \"- In the field of robotics, an AI-enabled robot right now can detect any obstacles in its route and plan an optimal way to get to the given location. These robots may be used to transport heavy equipment in warehouses and factories as well as clean public places. Those are the tasks that would usually necessitate the participation of so many persons.\",\n        \"In the gaming industry, we have an exceptional artificial intelligence named AlphaGo, a computer created to play the board game Go. AlphaGo can comprehend a human's realistic manner of playing by analyzing data from matches with different amateurs and professionals. In 2016, it surprised everyone when defeating Go Champion Lee Sedol 4-1, marking a milestone in artificial intelligence development.\",\n        \"- AI plays a crucial role in data analysis. Data analysts may employ AI to help them manage and analyze large databases. For example, they use Helixa, an AI program that provides insights into customer behavior with more accurate results. These services may be used by marketers to create more complete client profiles and better-targeted marketing campaigns.\",\n        \"- AI also assists in the fields of science and research. 'Eve,' an AI-based robot, is an excellent example. It discovered a component of toothpaste that can treat Malaria, a deadly illness claiming many lives in the past.\",\n        \"Big data and machine learning technologies may allow AI technology to advance further in the future. Big data is a broad term that refers to a variety of voluminous and high-speed digital information assets that cannot be handled with traditional methods. With the advancement of big data, there will be more amount of both structured and unstructured data for computers to evaluate at a faster rate. On the other hand, machine learning can assist in recognizing patterns in the data, categorizing it into various groups, and translating it into valuable insights.\",\n        \"- In the field of social media, because of the enormous number of users, there is also a large amount of data generated every day. Social media companies use AI to track users' activity to know about customer behaviors and interests based on the posts they like or the videos they watch. AI can draw a picture of the target audience and build a solid framework for their customers, allowing businesses to make informed decisions.

At no point is a human passenger necessary to assume control of the car, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. A self-driving automobile can go wherever a regular vehicle can and accomplish everything a skilled human driver can do. Self-driving cars are becoming more popular and fully operational than ever before. Although often advertised as driverless cars, there are currently no fully autonomous vehicles legally operating in countries worldwide.\",\n        \"The American Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines six levels of driving automation, ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully automated). These levels have been approved by the US Department of Transportation and are being applied worldwide.\",\n        \"- Level 0 – manual driving: Humans operate and control all major systems. This includes cars with cruise control because the driver sets and changes the speed as needed.\",\n        \"- Level 1 - driver assistance: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) help the driver with steering, braking, and acceleration, but not all simultaneously. A rearview camera and features such as vibrating seat alarms are included in ADAS to notify drivers when they stray from their driving lane. When triggered individually by human drivers, the automobile can control several systems, such as adaptive cruise control or automated braking. As a result, most cars nowadays are self-driving at level 1.\",\n        '- Level 2 - partial automation: Level 2 takes things a step farther, as one could imagine. The car can be more proactive in managing specific circumstances by integrating two or more advanced driver assistance systems, such as automated lane departure warning, lane maintenance and braking, or changing direction and acceleration. The driver can operate without paying much attention at this level, but they must constantly be \"alert\" to engage and ready to act.',\n        '- Level 3 - conditional automation: The third degree of automaticity, sometimes known as \"no need to watch the road\" mode, allows the driver to perform other things with their eyes-free, such as glance at a phone or tablet. Level 3 self-driving cars often do not require human intervention at speeds below 60 km/h.',\n        '- Level 4 - high automation: Through constant monitoring of road conditions, the automobile may autonomously change course, brake, or accelerate, and even avoid obstacles at level 4. The level 4 self-driving mechanism can only be triggered on excellent roads, guaranteeing that the vehicle can decelerate and stop safely when needed by enabling the driver to rest and sleep if desired.',\n        '- Level 5 – full automation: This is the highest level, demonstrating an actual self-driving automobile that can operate autonomously in all scenarios and settings without the need for human involvement. When the car is in motion, drivers may easily rest, sleep, or do anything they like. At this level, the automobile lacks even basic features like a steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal. Artificial intelligence is crucial in dealing with circumstances based on data from hundreds of sensors.',\n        'Complex technology demands everything from automated to autonomous driving, including advanced sensor technologies, sophisticated control systems, and intelligent actuators.

As a result, people will see more and more autonomous cars on the roads of many countries. Autonomous vehicles are indeed the future of transportation. Up to now, in the world, more than 30 companies are investing in the research and development of driverless cars, such as Google, Tesla, Apple, Audi, Nissan, Nvidia, etc. They support this field very strongly. As an electronics manufacturing corporation, Apple recently announced that it has successfully developed self-driving cars by 2024. The race for driverless vehicles still has many technological and technological gaps. 2021 will create an opportunity for legislators and consumers to test the feasibility of applying artificial intelligence in traffic.

Statistics show that driver error is the leading cause, causing more than 90% of all car crashes, and it is often the errors of driving while drunk, distracted, not moving in the right lane, or not complying with regulations, speed limits, etc. In addition, self-driving cars are expected to reduce traffic jams, as robot cars will be able to travel at higher speeds and closer to other vehicles without obstructing or crashing into them. This will ultimately reduce people's time on the road and save them energy.\",\n        \"When self-driving technology is established, fully autonomous self-driving vehicles will be available, but they might have significant economic implications. Taxi and truck drivers will no longer be required, resulting in many people who are now employed in these positions losing their employment. Trucks on the road without a driver could theoretically operate 24 hours a day, lowering freight expenses.

Firstly, many streets in Vietnam still lack road markings or are blurred or covered after a period of use. Secondly, the high traffic density makes the vehicle \"embarrassed\" because it cannot find a safe distance from other vehicles, especially motorbikes. Thirdly, operating self-driving cars in the situation that Vietnam's traffic is still \"chaotic\" due to lack of synchronization will bring many risks of loss of traffic safety. Many tests have shown that current self-driving cars are only most suitable when running on highways with open lanes and no obstacles. Even in modern and advanced cities, the operation in urban areas still has many problems. Therefore, I believe that I will not have the chance to experience this technology in my home country soon. Even though it will not affect my daily life, I would be happy to try it out in a foreign country someday.

In the future, we will frequently upgrade MinS with more locations and soundtracks, as well as fix and modify the website according to users' feedback at the same time.\",\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./header.css\";\nimport { teamName } from \"../const\";\nimport { GoMarkGithub } from \"react-icons/go\";\nimport { repoGithubUrl } from \"../const\";\n\nfunction Header() {\n  return (\n    <div id=\"title\">\n      <header className=\"navBar\">\n        <h2 className=\"teamName\">{teamName}</h2>\n        <div className=\"navItems\">\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#teamProfile\">\n              Team Profile\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#tools\">\n              Tools\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#ITWork\">\n              IT work\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#ITTechnologies\">\n              IT Technologies\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#projectIdeas\">\n              Project Ideas\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          {/* <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#feedback\">\n              Feedback\n            </a>\n          </span> */}\n        </div>\n      </header>\n      <div className=\"banner\">\n        <div className=\"bannerRight\">\n          <h1 className=\"message\">\n            Introduction to IT - Assignment 2: The IT World\n          </h1>\n          <a className='toolsLinks' href={repoGithubUrl}>\n            <button className=\"githubButton\">\n              <GoMarkGithub />\n              <span>Website's GitHub repository</span>\n            </button>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"bannerLeft\">\n          <img className=\"bannerImg\" src=\"Logo.png\" alt=\"programmer\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Header;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./footer.css\";\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    <footer className=\"footer\">\n      <div className=\"footerNav\">\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#teamProfile\">\n            Team Profile\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#tools\">\n            Tools\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#ITWork\">\n            IT work\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#ITTechnologies\">\n            IT Technologies\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#projectIdeas\">\n            Project Ideas\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        {/* <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#feedback\">\n            Feedback\n          </a>\n        </span> */}\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"copyright\">© Copyright 2021 Spotifour</div>\n    </footer>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Footer;\n","import React, { useMemo } from \"react\";\nimport \"./ITTechnologies.css\";\n\nfunction ITTechItem({ technology, description, image }) {\n  const itemDescription = useMemo(\n    () =>\n      Object.keys(description).map((item) => {\n        return (\n          <>\n            <h3 className=\"ITTechItemSection\">{item}</h3>\n            {description[item].map((paragraph) => {\n              return (\n                <>\n                  <p className=\"ITTechDescription\">{paragraph}</p>\n                  <br />\n                </>\n              );\n            })}\n          </>\n        );\n      }),\n    [description]\n  );\n  return (\n    <div className=\"ITTechItem\">\n      <h3 className=\"ITTechName\">{technology}</h3>\n      <img className=\"ITTechImage\" src={image} alt={technology} />\n      {itemDescription}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ITTechItem;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./ITTechnologies.css\";\nimport Slider from \"react-slick\";\nimport \"slick-carousel/slick/slick.css\";
