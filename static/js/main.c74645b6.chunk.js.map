In addition to developing websites, they also create mobile apps, integrate online customer channels with other systems like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), POS (Point Of Sales), and support customers on marketing activities.\",\n      \"Therefore, as a Chief Technology Officer of a technological company, he handles those major areas:\",\n      \"- Develop company technical stacks, keep them up to date with technology changes\",\n      \"- Develop employees’ technical skills\",\n      \"- Deploys, maintains business applications, services, and infrastructure\",\n      \"- Monitors, optimizes, troubleshoots the performance of applications, services and infrastructure\",\n      \"- Do technical lead, write boilerplate code, review code\",\n      \"Besides technical tasks, he also participates in general company management activities like interviewing candidates, reviewing employees annually, and building a company learning culture.\",\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    question:\n      \"What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?\",\n    answer: [\n      \"He interacts with a variety of people at work. Because he is a tech lead, he primarily interacts with the developers. He helps them come up with solutions for their problems, reviews their code, and trains them. Besides that, he also works with the project management and quality assurance teams to discuss projects timeline, working quality, human resources, etc. Last but not least, he also joins with the BA (Business Analysis) team to work directly with the clients in clarifying their business requirements, so his company can provide appropriate solutions for their needs.\",\n      \"In terms of his interaction with other IT professionals, he likes watching videos and reading their blog posts to acquire new skills. Moreover, he also wants to share his knowledge with others in the same ways. Therefore, he has his personal blog for this, where he posts things about Magento, website technologies and DevOps. To attract more people to see his blog, he usually shares posts on programming groups on Facebook or Twitter. He finds that Twitter is a pretty good place where IT professionals can learn new things from others, keep them up to date with technology changes in their fields, as well as share their knowledge.\",\n      \"His role does not require him to contact the general public. His company only provides eCommerce solutions for clients, and those customers are the people who are responsible for managing their web as well as communicating with users - the general public.\",\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    question: \"Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?\",\n    answer: [\n      \"He said that he spent the most time reviewing code and setting up a working environment at the company's office. He always prioritizes achieving high coding quality to deliver the best product quality to customers. He takes responsibility for many projects at a time, so reviewing code is the most critical and time-consuming part of his daily work. It usually takes him about 1 - 2 hours to do this daily.\",\n      \"His other tasks include setting up the working environment for each project, deploying websites, providing any supplies if needed, ensuring the team members have everything they need. Every computer comes with an on-ear headphone to keep users from being distracted by outside noises. Each employee also has a personal space where they can store personal items such as writing pads, catalog envelopes, self-stick notes, and so on. Snacks, tea, and coffee are also available on two tables for employees to use whenever they are tired or hungry. Thanks to those working conditions, all technical employees can focus on coding, and not have to worry about other problems that might distract them.\",\n      \"For him, the office is a second home where he eats, sometimes even cooks, does exercises, and communicates with others on a daily basis. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were times that he and his co-workers were not allowed to go to the offices, so he had to spend most of his time working alone at home.

Leading people means dealing with different personalities and abilities. He always has to find and understand how to develop an employee to their best version and improve their work skills to add more value to the company in the market. Technically, he thinks that there is no best way to work for everyone. Some may enjoy working with Frontend technologies like Javascript, CSS, React, ... or some may find Backend or DevOps interesting. He identifies their strengths and gives them suggestions, training sessions, or courses so they can develop themselves most effectively.\",\n      \"In addition, interacting with clients is another aspect he finds challenging. He must fill the gap between business people and the technical team because they usually have misunderstandings. Sometimes, the technical team do not understand clearly the requirement of customers and As a technical person, he also needs to understand how customer business works, not only online eCommerce, but also many problems around it, like marketing tools, order management process, stock management, SEO, or any other system.\",\n    ],\n  },\n];\n\nexport const ITTechs = [\n  {\n    technology: \"Web Development\",\n    image: \"Web.png\",\n    description:\n      \"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

With busy urban lifestyles, more and more people find hearing natural and comfortable sounds a great way to relax, relieve stress, and increase productivity. It can be the sound of wind blowing from high on top of mountains, the hum of insects and animals deep into the jungle, and also somewhere we are more familiar, like inside of the coffee shop where we hear people chatting along with the melodies of the songs. That idea, combined with our love of coding and technologies, has inspired us to build a small website where people can enjoy some unique sounds of different places. Moreover, users can adjust relative sound levels to achieve perfectly balanced background noise. We call it “Mix in Sounds” or “MinS”.\",\n  motivation:\n    \"According to soundofsleep.com, background sounds that usually contain white noise have been shown to have promising results in improving behaviours and productivity. To be specific, it helps us enhance memories, deepens our meditation, sleep quality as well as improves concentration. MinS is developed to bring people a better quality of life with its pristine soundtracks and beautiful photographs. In addition, this website also provides Pomodoro – a study tracking tool that people can use while studying and Spotify integrations if they want to enjoy some of their favourite songs. Anyone can access the website right on their phones, tablets, or laptops, and it will be available on famous browsers like Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.\",\n  description: [\n    \"In general, MinS is a simple and easy-to-use website. When we first open up, the whole screen will be covered in black, and the logo will slowly appear. After that, it displays, under the logo, “Welcome to Mix in Sounds”, followed by a short description of the website. Users will then be asked to choose between four locations - Chilling by the Sea, Exploring the Forest, Relaxing in a Coffee Shop, and Working at the office – which is shown in turn. The website will play a demo sound of that place along with beautiful scenery in the background interface for each location.  After choosing the desired location, the website will relocate them to a new page, and more soundtracks will be provided. To be more specific, inside the forest, we can hear the light wind, vibrating trees, insects buzz, campfire, as well as the sounds of animals like birds, snakes, and monkeys. When choosing the seaside option, we can hear waves crashing on the shore, sand crunching underfoot, the sound of seagulls and other coastal birds. If users choose to go to a bustling area like a coffee shop, there will be the sound of people chatting, the barista who prepares the beverage for us, the coffee cup, and the drinking sound. Last but not least is at the office where users can hear the sound of discussion, people moving around, writing, and studying. There are also different kinds of weather used in all locations like rainy, windy, sunny, and snowy. It is crucial that all of the sounds are high quality to provide the best user experience.\",\n    \"In terms of the layout, the header, where the website logo and different locations are located, will lie on top of the window, and users can navigate to other places by clicking on them. The set of sounds will be on the right side of the screen. There will be a control bar for each sound for users to adjust. They can choose the sounds they desire by clicking on the play button and dragging the circle dot to the right for higher volume and the other for lowering. The play button will then be changed into the pause symbol in case users want to stop the sound.\",\n    \"Underneath the sounds control panel, there are four circles with an icon inside, representing the weather mentioned before. Users can hold their mouse on that button, drag it up or down to adjust the volume.\",\n    \"For music lovers, the Spotify player is located on the left side of the window and has some default music chosen by the host. If the users have a premium Spotify account, they can also log in and enjoy the entire length of the songs instead of the 30s each. The sound adjusting bar and playback & skip button are also provided for the users for better adjustment.\",\n    \"Pomodoro is one of the trending education tools to help us keep track of our studies time and work effectively. It will be included on the website and displayed on top of the Spotify player. The default option is 25 minutes of working time, followed by 5 minutes of break. Users could also adjust the desired time by clicking on the “EDIT” button. After that, the interface of the Pomodoro will change, and there will be two arrows up-down for us to choose the desired working time.\",\n    \"If the users are satisfied with the website, they can also support us by clicking on the “Support us” button on the bottom left of the interface. They will then be taken to a page where users can find more information about the creators and send a small donation. On the right side of the donation box is some extra information about the website, including the creators, the releasing date, and our slogan.\",\n    \"The colour and size of every button will change slightly if the users hover their cursor on them. In addition, if they hover on each button, there will be a comment pop-up to provide some additional information about that button. The colour and font shown on the website will depend on the background pictures of different locations. Moreover, we would like to use not too bright colours for the website along with stylish and exquisite fonts.\",\n  ],\n  toolsAndTechnologies:\n    \"The main technology for building this project is ReactJS. It is utilized for building front-end components, including the sounds control panel, header, Pomodoro section, etc. HTML and CSS will also be used for structuring and styling the project. In addition, Spotify API will be integrated into the website for playing songs and users' logins. For the soundtracks, some sounds would be easy for us to record while others need to be rented from other sources like My Noise – one of the best background noise generators on the internet. To have high resolution and nice-exposure pictures, we can use images from Unsplash – a photo discovery platform for free to use, high-definition photos. In addition, Firebase will be used to store the database, different sound packages, and high-quality pictures. Finally, we will use GitHub and Git for handling version controls and remote repositories.\",\n  skillsRequired:\n    \"In order to build this website, it is crucial to be proficient at languages and frameworks for frontend development like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS library. In addition, getting familiar with Firebase and RestAPI could help us work with the Spotify API and backend server. We also need to know about design principles: the font of the letter, the size, colours, and layout of different components to build a nice-looking interface for the project. Furthermore, being familiar with Git and npm command-line interface (including add, commit, push, and pull commands) and managing remote repositories on GitHub is also required. Last but not least, interpersonal skills and teamwork skills to collaborate with other team members are also essential to have.\",\n  outcome:\n    \"We aim to start MinS with a website platform and then transition to a mobile application that can run on both IOS and Android devices. RMIT students will be the first to utilize MinS before it is made available to other Internet users. If this project is successfully deployed, people will have a nice place to relax and enjoy high-quality melodies even if they are in bustling areas of the city. In addition, people can also use MinS while studying to improve concentration and efficiency or while sleeping to have a good relaxation. In the future, we will frequently upgrade MinS with more locations and soundtracks, as well as fix and modify the website according to users' feedback at the same time.\",\n};\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./header.css\";\nimport { teamName } from \"../const\";\nimport { GoMarkGithub } from \"react-icons/go\";\nimport { repoGithubUrl } from \"../const\";\n\nfunction Header() {\n  return (\n    <div id=\"title\">\n      <header className=\"navBar\">\n        <h2 className=\"teamName\">{teamName}</h2>\n        <div className=\"navItems\">\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#teamProfile\">\n              Team Profile\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#tools\">\n              Tools\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#ITWork\">\n              IT work\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#ITTechnologies\">\n              IT Technologies\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#projectIdeas\">\n              Project Ideas\n            </a>\n          </span>\n          {/* <span>\n            <a className=\"navItem\" href=\"#feedback\">\n              Feedback\n            </a>\n          </span> */}\n        </div>\n      </header>\n      <div className=\"banner\">\n        <div className=\"bannerRight\">\n          <h1 className=\"message\">\n            Introduction to IT - Assignment 2: The IT World\n          </h1>\n          <a className='toolsLinks' href={repoGithubUrl}>\n            <button className=\"githubButton\">\n              <GoMarkGithub />\n              <span>Website's GitHub repository</span>\n            </button>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"bannerLeft\">\n          <img className=\"bannerImg\" src=\"Logo.png\" alt=\"programmer\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Header;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./footer.css\";\n\nfunction Footer() {\n  return (\n    <footer className=\"footer\">\n      <div className=\"footerNav\">\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#teamProfile\">\n            Team Profile\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#tools\">\n            Tools\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#ITWork\">\n            IT work\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#ITTechnologies\">\n            IT Technologies\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#projectIdeas\">\n            Project Ideas\n          </a>\n        </span>\n        {/* <span>\n          <a className=\"footerNavItem\" href=\"#feedback\">\n            Feedback\n          </a>\n        </span> */}\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"copyright\">© Copyright 2021 Spotifour</div>\n    </footer>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Footer;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./ITTechnologies.css\";\n\nfunction ITTechItem({technology, description, image}) {\n  return (\n    <div className='ITTechItem'>\n      <h3 className='ITTechName'>{technology}</h3>\n      <img className='ITTechImage' src={image} alt={technology} />\n      <p className='ITTechDescription'>{description}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ITTechItem; ","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./ITTechnologies.css\";\nimport Slider from \"react-slick\";\nimport \"slick-carousel/slick/slick.css\"; \nimport \"slick-carousel/slick/slick-theme.css\";\nimport ITTechItem from \"./ITTechItem\";\nimport { ITTechs } from '../const';\n\n\nfunction ITTechnologies() {\n  const settings = {\n    dots: true,\n    infinite: true,\n    speed: 1000,\n    slidesToShow: 2,\n    slidesToScroll: 2,\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div id=\"ITTechnologies\">\n      <h2 className=\"sectionName\">IT Technologies</h2>\n      <Slider {...settings}>\n        {\n          ITTechs.map((item) => (\n            <ITTechItem technology={item.technology} description={item.description} image={item.image} />\n          ))\n        }\n      </Slider>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ITTechnologies;\n","import React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport \"./ITWork.css\";\nimport { AiOutlineCaretDown, AiOutlineCaretUp } from \"react-icons/ai\";\n\nfunction QnA({ question, answer }) {\n  const [openAnswer, setOpenAnswer] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"QnA\">\n      <div className=\"question\">\n        <p>{question}</p>\n        <span>\n          {openAnswer ?
